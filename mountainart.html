                The goal of this project was to create a piece of art for my kitchen wall. I knew I wanted it to be
                focused on the mountains and contain some kind of light.
                Inspired by the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia I created the drawing in AutoCAD.

                This drawing had all the mountains I wanted and allowed for nice depth of field but it was not ready to
                laser cut. I needed to fit each mountain on to a 1'x2' piece of 1/4" plywood.
                I ended up splicing the big picture into 6 pieces.
                <br>

                <br>
                These 6 panels would be what I cut on the laser cutter. I took these dxf files from AutoCAD and
                imported them into Fusion360 to get a better idea for the depth. Fusion360 allowed me to see how far
                apart I wanted the panels to be and how far off the wall I wanted the wood to hang.
                <br>

                <br>
                I created several brackets that would hold the 6 panels together and give the entire peice structure.
                These brackets would also gave me a spot to attach the peice to the wall.

                <br>
                I then laser cut all the pieces from cardboard to make sure they fit together well.
                <br>

                It was time to cut all the panels from 1/4" plywood. Once the panels were cut I stained them based on
                their layer and mounted the panels to the brackets.

                <br>
                With the wood work done it was time to wire the LEDs. I made sure to place them right behind each panel
                so they would not be visable from the front.

                This is how it turned out.
