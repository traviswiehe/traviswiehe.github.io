                My desk at home was feeling dark and needed a light. I had always wanted to build a lamp and this was
                perfect opportunity.
                Inspired by the Japanese paper and wood room dividers I wanted to build something in that style.
                <img src="lampinspire.jfif" alt="Inspired" class="image" style="width:100%">
                I then created some patterns in AutoCAD I thought could work.
                <img src="lamppatterns.PNG" alt="Patterns" class="image" style="width:100%">
                I tested all the patterns for the one I liked the most but ended up picking two patterns and using both.
                This gave the final piece some nice wall shadows.

                I cut the basic design out of foam board first to make sure everything looked good and fit together.

                I now needed to cut the final pieces out of 1/8" plywood and stain them. The key part to this lamp would
                be the light defusion
                through the holes. I cut some thin clear acrylic and sanded it using 300 grit sand paper to make it
                translucent. This gave the acrylic a nice
                faded look which was exactly what I was looking for. Below is the final result.
