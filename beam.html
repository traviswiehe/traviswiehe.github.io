                The goal of the project was to perform beam vibration measurements, plot them over time, and compare
                them to the theoricial results.
                I placed a strain gauge on a metal ruler and was able to strain at a given time in the beam. Below is my
                experimental setup.

                Using this setup I placed different amounts of coins on the end of the beam and measured the
                displacment. From this I was able to
                calculate the beam stiffness

                Using the stiffness coefficient I could do some dynamic testing with the beam. By placing my finger on
                the end of the beam and pushing down
                I created some initial displacment in the tip of the beam.

                When I released my finger the beam vibrated up and down as I recorded the strain data. This strain data
                was then converted into tip position data
                that is seen below.

                This data was them compared to the mechanical vibrations equations for a beam. The data was a close
                match and validated the theoricial equations and the experimental results.
