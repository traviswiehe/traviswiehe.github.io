                I am a mechanical engineering student at Virginia Tech. I have a passion for the outdoors, love creating
                something new, and a goal to never stop learning. <br><br>

                Over the past 4 years, I have been fortunate to gain experience not only at Virginia Tech but also in
                the field. In the spring of 2021,
                I worked for Lutron as a mechanical engineering co-op and helped them design, prototype, and patent a
                new motored window shade. At Lutron, I became familiar with PI planning, CREO, ANSYS, and Microsoft
                teams. Along with design-for-manufacturing principals, and how to dimension a drawing.
                <br><br>
                In 2020, I worked
                for Dennis Group, a design-build firm for the food and beverage industry. While
                I was there, I learned from senior engineers how they manage their time and communicated with other
                professionals. I got a close look at the design-build process and quickly learned the
                industry. Along with the Dennis Group, I worked for the start-up Rendyr. Rendyr is building the first
                foldable laser cutter. As the only engineer on their team, I worked with other disciplines to make a
                product that works well, looks great, and is intuitive.
                <br><br>
                The past two summers, I worked as a Day Camp Counselor in Palo Alto to improve my communication skills. As
                they say “If you can work with kids you can work with anyone”. I have learned a ton along the way and am
                excited to bring my experience from these opportunities into my future work!
                <br><br>
                Outside of work and school I am a big runner and climber. I am always planning my next big adventure to
                the mountains. Below are some of my favorite places I have been.
